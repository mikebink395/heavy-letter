Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Our website currently has an aesthetic homepage, a functioning registration/login/profile display system, and a basic menu framework.
For our college search feature, we found an API from the department of Education from which to pull data about thousands of schools.
We have figured out how to pull admissions data from different years based on queries such as college name, college size, and other parameters.
We have a database for the student-athlete page in which users have access to the name and email addresses of the head coaches for Football, Swim,
Track, and Soccer for universities in the SEC, ACC, Big10, Pac-12, NESCAC, and Ivy League.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Most of the website still has to be aestheticized. We are currently wrapping up the implementation of the college search feature.
We still need to implement the guidance page for student athletes; on this page, the user will be able to find a step-by-step
recruiting guide detailing the process as a whole, emails for coaches, and also a template for how to reach out / communicate
with college coaches. We have yet to implement a planned messaging system between two different kinds of users (student and admin).

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Since we couldnâ€™t use the CS50 database, figuring out how to use SQL databases in partnership with Flask proved to be a larger challenge
than anticipated. As a result, much effort was dedicated to the creation of a functioning login/registration system that accounted for
all of the relevant stats of a college applicant. The document for the API is extremely hard to read, and we are still in the process of
figuring out how to access all the data from the API. We had to sort the JSON from a very general request in order to figure out how to
access a lot of the data.
